# Job Mailer

## Overview

Job Mailer is a modern, full-stack web application designed to automate and streamline the process of sending personalized cold emails to HRs and recruiters. Built with React (frontend), Node.js/Express (backend), and MongoDB, it leverages Gmail integration for secure, real email delivery. The UI is clean, card-based, and responsive, using Tailwind CSS for a professional look.

## Why This Project?

Searching for jobs and reaching out to HRs is time-consuming and repetitive. I built Job Mailer to:

- Save time by automating personalized outreach.
- Centralize contact, resume, and template management.
- Provide a secure, privacy-focused alternative to mass email tools.
- Learn and demonstrate full-stack development, OAuth, and cloud deployment best practices.

## Thought Process

The project was designed to be:

- **User-centric:** Simple, intuitive dashboard for non-technical users.
- **Secure:** Uses Google OAuth and never stores your Google password.
- **Scalable:** Easily deployable and maintainable for both personal and public use.
- **Transparent:** Clear privacy policy, data deletion, and user control features.
